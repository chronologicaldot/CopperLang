2017/2/14
v 2-0.17

- Changed template<class T> instances to template<typename T> for standards conformance, though it doesn't matter.
- Fixed bug in Engine::processLoop() that didn't clear unfinished tasks above the loop task.
- Added check for invalid token between "loop" and body.

EngMsgToStr.h

====================
2017/2/12
v 2-0.17

- Changed "type" to "type_of".
- LANG CHANGE: Version 2.01.
- Fixed bug in String::isLiteralNumber() that failed to properly bound numbers to the range 0-9 and check for decimal.

docs.html
- Updated function information and some tag coloring.

Now tracking CopperLang/IDE folder, containing GTK-sourceview syntax highlighting files.

TODO:
- FIXME: ObjectNumber has no way of being identified as separate from the Number class, thereby making its functions useless. There should be some way of indicating what kind of number it is.


====================
2017/2/12
v 2-0.17

Now on branch "master".

This is the new master branch with syntax changes. The key change is the creation of functions using square brackets instead of "fn". Details will be outlined in docs/docs.html.
Extensions in this branch may use new naming conventions, including the inclusion of numbers and special symbols in names.

- Defined COPPER_VIRTUAL_MACHINE_BRANCH as 2.
- Removed #define COPPER_SHORT_CIRCUIT_FN for enabling short-circuit of function creating using "fn".
- Made #define COPPER_ENABLE_EXTENDED_NAME_SET on by default and added undef macro for disabling it.
- Changed COPPER_LANG_VERSION to 2.
- Changed function creation.
-- Added TT_objectbody_open and TT_objectbody_close.
-- Removed TASK_FCS_from_fn.
-- Changed Engine::constructFunctionFromFN() to Engine::constructFunctionFromObjBody().
-- Changed Engine::interpret() case TT_function_declare to use TT_objectbody_open.
-- Changed Engine::isSpecialCharacter() to look for square brackets and label them TT_objectbody_open,close.

====================
2017/2/2-3
v 0.14

====================
2017/1/25-30
v 0.121

- Created struct (interface) Number and changed NumberObjectFactory to use it. This interface inherits class Data (Object) and contains unsigned long getAsUnsignedLong() const.
- Added ObjectNumber::getAsUnsignedLong().
- Added constructor (const unsigned long) to CharList.
- Added constructors () and (const unsigned long) to ObjectNumber.
- Added default construction for Object that defaults the object type to data so users don't need to set it.
- Changed all FunctionContainer constructors to set their type to ObjectType::Function.
- LANG CHANGE: Made "this" pointer creation in runFunction optional, default off.
-- Added define COPPER_ENABLE_CALLBACK_THIS_POINTER to allow enabling.
- Removed function String Cu::getStringValue( const Object& ).
- Fixed bug that prevented using the immediate-run token in a function execution body (a ={b:}). The task state needed to be set to TASK_FF_collect_params.


====================
2017/1/24
v 0.12

- Added String::toUnsignedLong().
- Changed 0xffffffff comparisons with unsigned max to (unsigned int)-1.
- LANG CHANGE: Added the immediate-run/parameterless call option.
-- Added TT_immediate_run.
-- Changed Engine::FuncFound_processFromStart() switch to check for it.
-- Changed Engine::Engine::isSpecialCharacter() to translate it from the colon character.
- Changed Variable::setFunc() to store container copy before dereferencing (for copies) and reference passed container before dereferencing (for pointers) in case of self-assignment. This does not fix a problem for normal usage (since the VM saves a reference to the data elsewhere) but would have affected deep hooks built in to the VM for IDEs.
- Changed COPPER_LANG_VERSION to 1.2 given the syntax change significance.


=====================
2017/1/16 - 2017/1/21
v 0.11

Goals:
- Improve debugging mechanisms.
- Finalize API.
- Finalize core documentation.

- Implemented debugging features.
-- Added ID to FunctionContainer and made (Function*) constructor (Function*, unsigned int) for setting the ID.
-- Added unsigned int Engine::generateFunctionID().
-- Added void Logger::printFunctionError(unsigned int, unsigned int).
-- Added Engine::printFunctionError(unsigned int, unsigned int) for printing function ID and bad token index.
-- Modified Engine::FuncFound_processRunVariable() and Engine::runFunction() to save token index and use Engine::printFunctionError().
-- Added void Engine::setStackTracePrintingEnabled(bool).
- Changed COPPER_LANG_VERSION to 0.11.
- Changed utilList.h uint from unsigned int to unsigned long.

premake5.lua
- Created premake file.

To do:
- Remove old build scripts.


=====================
2017/1/13, 2017/1/15
v 0.1

- LANG_CHANGE: Finished adding set_member() and type().
- Fixed bug in Engine::process_sys_return() that set the last object using the param iterator when there was no parameter.
- Fixed bug in Engine::processIfStatement() that failed to return when the function mailbox was set.
- LANG CHANGE: Renamed "is_..." functions to "are_" functions whenever they processed more than one variable.
-- Affected: is_fn(), is_empty(), is_bool(), is_string(), is_number().
- Removed writeToInt(), writeToFloat(), and writeToDouble() from ObjectNumber and added getRawValue().
- Fixed bug in Variable::getCopy() that deep copied pointers though it should only deep copy owned function containers.

docs.html:
- Added info about "end_main".
- Added "is_owner()".
- Added "set_member()".
- Added "type()".
- Changed "is_fn()", "is_empty()", "is_bool()", "is_string()", and "is_number()".
- Minor fixes and updates.


=====================
2017/1/5 - 2017/1/6
v 0.1

- Changed List<T> to have and use IndexOutOfBoundsException for operator[](uint) and getFromBack(uint).

- Changed COPPER_VERSION to COPPER_LANG_VERSION and set it to 1.
- Added COPPER_VIRTUAL_MACHINE_VERSION and set it to 0.11.
- Removed stream parameter from tokenize.
- Created blank implementations of copy constructors for Variable, Scope, and TaskFunctionFound. These are deleted when the COMPILE_FOR_C_PLUS_PLUS_11 flag is enabled.
- Changed Logger::log functions to Logger::print.
- Fixed bug in CharList(int) constructor that overflowed when the digit size was that of INT_MAX or close.
- Created NumberObjectFactory and set up the Engine to use it during constructNumber. Added setter.
- Moved const char* dataName() from class Data to class Object, and implemented empty version for FunctionContainer.
- Added bool isObjectOfType( const Object&, const char* ).
- Changed Object::dataName() to Object::typeName().
- Fixed data leak of object copying:
-- In static FunctionContainer* createInitialized(Object*), changed result.set() to result.setWithoutRef().
-- Removed implementation of Object::copy() and implemented it for ObjectBool, ObjectString, and ObjectNumber. This is required to reduce the chance of accidental mismanagement of reference counting by object implementors.

Technically, this project started a few months earlier and gradually picked up speed.
